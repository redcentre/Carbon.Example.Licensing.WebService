# Description

The **RCS.Licensing.Example.WebService.Shared** library contains public classes that are shared by the example licensing web service and client applications. The class `ExampleLicensingServiceClient` is a strongly-typed wrapper for .NET clients to call the web api endpoints.

:boom: This project can create a NuGet package, but since there are no public .NET projects contacting the xample web service, the package is not created or published.
